# The Universe is flat.

_Why is that odd?_

Because there are infinitely many ways to make a curved universe, but only one way to make a flat one.

It’s very unlikely that our Universe is flat for no reason.

We just don’t know for sure what the reason is.

One idea is that the universe went through a period of very rapid _inflation_ at the beginning.
