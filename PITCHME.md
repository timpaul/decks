# The Universe is everything.

The Universe is just the name we have for everything.

People, planets, asteroids, comets, stars, galaxies, empty space, gas clouds, radio waves, light beams…

There’s a lot we’d like to know about it:

- how big is it?
- how old is it?
- what shape is it?
- what is it made of?
- what will happen to it?
- why does it exist?

_Let’s go!…_

# The Universe is full of stuff.

In every direction we look, we see the same stuff.

Galaxies, each one made out of billions of stars.

We’re inside one ourselves. We call it _The Milky Way_.

They form in huge clusters and filaments. We give them names like _The Giant Arc_ and the _Perseus-Pegasus Filament_.

In between the filaments are immense voids of empty space we call things like _The Eridanus Supervoid_.

And this is just the stuff we can see.

# We can’t see all the stuff.

In fact, it turns out we can only see about 5% of it.

We know from the way the galaxies move there must be loads of other stuff out there that we can’t detect.

We call this stuff dark matter and dark energy.

We don’t really know what it is yet.

But wait.

There’s another reason we can’t see all the stuff…

# The Universe is big.

It is ridiculously big.

It’s so big that we can only see the region that’s immediately around us.

We can see the stuff in this region because the light from it has had time to reach us.

We assume that there’s more stuff beyond this region, but we’ll never get to see it.

We call this region we're in, the Observable Universe.

# This is the Observable Universe.

It’s 93 billion light years across.

A light year is 9.46 trillion km. It’s the distance light travels in a year.

You can see the filaments of superclusters and empty voids.

# The Universe is expanding.

Our observations tell us that all of the galaxies in our Universe are moving away from each other.

So the universe must be expanding, which also means that it must have been smaller in the past.

Working backwards, we think that our whole Universe must have once been concentrated in a single point.

We call this the Big Bang.

It happened about 17.4 billion years ago.

We don’t know what happened before then.

# The Universe is flat.

_Wait… flat?_

It’s hard to imagine, but it _could_ have been curved.

Curved in a similar way that the surface of the Earth is curved, but it feels flat when you’re on it.

If you keep moving in the same direction on Earth, you’ll eventually get back to where you started.

The same could have been true for our Universe. Then, it would be finite in size, but it wouldn’t have any edges.

But it appears to be flat, which is actually quite odd…

# The Universe is flat.

_Why is that odd?_

Because there are infinitely many ways to make a curved universe, but only one way to make a flat one.

It’s very unlikely that our Universe is flat for no reason.

We just don’t know for sure what the reason is.

One idea is that the universe went through a period of very rapid _inflation_ at the beginning.

# The Universe is old.

# What is space?

At first we thought that space was like an empty box that things happen in over time.

Things could move around inside the box, but the space inside the box was just… empty space.

What’s more, we assumed that time ticked at the same rate everywhere.

We were wrong.

# Enter spacetime.

Einstein showed us that space and time are both aspects of a single, flexible _thing_.

We call it… _spacetime_!

Time is just a 4th dimension - alongside the other 3 space ones.

And spacetime isn’t fixed - it can bend and warp around things.

It does this around massive objects, like planets. It’s why things orbit.

# Is spacetime real?

Some people now think that events don’t happen _in_ spacetime, they somehow _are_ spacetime.

In this view, events and relations are fundamental, and _things_ only exist in relation to _other_ things.

Spacetime emerges from this web of relations, the same way that heat emerges from thermodynamics.

And time is just our subjective experience of increasing entropy.

_Entropy?_
