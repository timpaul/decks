# The Universe is everything.

The Universe is just the name we have for everything.

People, planets, asteroids, comets, stars, galaxies, empty space, gas clouds, radio waves, light beams…

There’s a lot we’d like to know about it:

- how big is it?
- how old is it?
- what shape is it?
- what is it made of?
- what will happen to it?
- why does it exist?
